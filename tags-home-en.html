These 4 qualities will be referenced time and again when creating guidelines to assess each step.
<!-- tags:24-->							<a href="home-en.html#qualities">more...</a>
<!-- tags:25-->						<h2>Services</h2>
<!-- tags:26-->						<p><strong class="msastyle">msa</strong> operates in three comprehensive service areas:</p>
<!-- tags:27-->							<p>1. <strong>expert skills</strong> in modeling, simulation and analysis through software development, quantitative analysis, and business analysis.</p>
<!-- tags:28-->							<p>2. <strong>training and coaching</strong>: how to communicate to collaborators, decision makers, and investors decisively and judiciously using quantitative tools?</p>
<!-- tags:29-->							<p>3. <strong>Build a global risk analysis solution</strong>, namely risk identification, designing the solution and its integration into the information system, choosing suitable technologies, recruiting collaborators, planning and monitoring the project.</p>	
<!-- tags:30-->						<h2>Why ?</h2>
<!-- tags:31-->						<p>Before starting a business venture, an entrepreneur assesses its profitability. He estimates the cost of the product or service and the price at which he could sell it. He calculates his profit margin from difference between the two quantities. This calculation suggests an optimistic scenario: everything will go well.</p>
<!-- tags:32-->						<p>The Entrepreneur knows that this hypothesis is unrealistic. He should take into consideration unforeseen incidents during the course of the project and then consider a more pessimist scenario. It would be more realistic to combine the two scenarios for a more balanced result. It is now clear that the initial, more simple calculation is becoming more complex. All the same, integrating a risk factor into the calculation is essential.</p>
<!-- tags:33-->						<p>These “incidents” or risks take various forms:</p>
<!-- tags:34-->							<li> - malfunction within the company,</li>
<!-- tags:35-->							<li> - behavior of the customers or supplier,</li>
<!-- tags:36-->							<li> - price variation in goods or services sold or bought by the company,</li>
<!-- tags:37-->							<li> - the availability of resources required.</li>
<!-- tags:38-->							<p>These risks will lead to additional costs. These risks might be ignored initially, but they will catch up with the entrepreneur in the course of daily operations. The source of the problem should be urgently identified and a solution found.</p>
<!-- tags:39-->							<p>This task will be difficult and expensive for several reasons:</p>
<!-- tags:40-->							<li> - the source of the problem may be not obvious at first,</li>
<!-- tags:41-->							<li> - repetition of the problem will be difficult and costly,</li>
<!-- tags:42-->							<li> - the analysis and search for a sustainable solution may be impaired. You might be tempted to use shortcuts,</li>
<!-- tags:43-->							<li> - these incidents will lead to extra charges that can’t be passed on to the customer,</li>
<!-- tags:44-->							<p>It would be astute to prepare in advance and respond more efficiently when incidents do occur.</p>
<!-- tags:45-->							<p>To do so, you must establish a risk analysis solution.</p>
<!-- tags:46-->							<p>Your risk analysis solution will have different objectives:</p>
<!-- tags:47-->							<li> - Estimation of resources needed for new business activity,</li>
<!-- tags:48-->							<li> - Assessment and optimization of profitability given the risks involved,</li>
<!-- tags:49-->							<li> - Determination of risks in order to facilitate growth carefully.</li>
<!-- tags:50-->						<h2>Your own solution</h2>
<!-- tags:51-->						<p>You could use a turnkey solution like ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning). ERP editors commonly provide software already developed and used by their clients. Unfortunately, this software is often expensive and complex for a company in a developmental phase. Moreover, they are not suitable for ventures using new information and communication technologies. Finally, the ERP customer does not own the solution and remains dependent on the ERP editor. An innovative company using new information and communication technologies has a wide range of IT skills. With the expert skills provided by MSA, you can build and customize your own risk analysis solution, with full ownership and control.</p>
<!-- tags:52-->						<p>Risk analysis solutions were once reserved only for big companies and banks. They involved costly infrastructures and scarce skills. Today, thanks to the democratization of new information and communication technologies, a small company can reasonably consider setting up its own risk analysis solution. The solution will play an important role in the company’s efficient and sustainable growth.</p>

He also received a Master in Probability and Finance from the University Pierre & Marie Curie (Paris VI). Since 1999, Richard has worked in investment banking (Natixis, Calyon) as a software engineer, quantitative analyst, and risk manager. He is specialized in the valuation of derivatives, pricing, and risk management in the dealing room.</p>
<!-- tags:55-->						<p>He has had the opportunity to collaborate on multiple international projects involving numerous stakeholders in various roles:</p>
<!-- tags:56-->						<li> - Software engineer</li>
<!-- tags:57-->						<li> - Quantitative analyst</li>
<!-- tags:58-->						<li> - Business Analyst</li>
<!-- tags:59-->						<li> - Risk manager</li>
<!-- tags:60-->						<h2>Method</h2>
<!-- tags:96-->						<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>
<!-- tags:61-->						<p>The methodology contains 3 steps: Modeling, Simulation and Analysis.</p>
<!-- tags:62-->						<p>The model can be defined as a simplified but significant business activity scheme. It is paramount to find a good compromise between the accuracy of the model (taking into account the risks involved as realistically as possible) and its efficiency (it should be easy to understand and to simulate). It should be noted that the model is dedicated to change. In the early stages of a project, very little information and experience with the business is available and the information system is under-developed. It would be counteractive to use a complex model. When the business activity matures, we seize the opportunity to have it evolve towards greater realism.</p>
<!-- tags:63-->						<p>The model will be a priori stochastic. The variables that form it are multi-faceted:</p>
<!-- tags:64-->						<li> - The modeled risk axes (the number of transactions carried out, the market prices of the products bought and sold, the number of fraudulent transactions etc …). These quantities cannot be controlled. Only their stochasticity and dynamic can be measured.</li>
<!-- tags:65-->						<li> - The model parameters (mean or variance). Those quantities define the risk axes stochasticity. We should estimate and measure those quantities at the beginning of the project. The quality of the measurement will depend on appropriate choices in the information system.</li>
<!-- tags:66-->						<li> - The levers. They correspond to the leeway available to manage the business activity; for instance the margin policy, the inventory, which kind of customer is favored, etc …</li>
<!-- tags:67-->						<p>The creation of a model is not just a mathematical problem. It needs a good analysis of business activity, environment and priorities. In theory, the universe of possible models is infinite. In practice it is much smaller. The appropriate choice of the model, which takes into account all the business activity constraints, is indispensable to the success of the solution.</p>
<!-- tags:97-->						<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>							
<!-- tags:68-->						<p>The simulation is the practical implementation, or rather, the informed implementation of software. This is the most technical part of the methodology. The model is just an idea; the simulation will produce a set of numbers from which the analysis will be built.</p>
<!-- tags:69-->						<p>In the case of simple models, closed formulas will be established. For more complex models, numerical methods for simulation will be used.</p>
<!-- tags:70-->						<p>Cross-skills in IT and mathematics are essential to the success of this step.</p>
<!-- tags:98-->						<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<!-- tags:71-->						<p>The last stage, the analysis, will be the most decisive and is based on the results of the previous stages. Indicators for decision-making will be defined:</p>
<!-- tags:72-->						<li> - New customer transactions</li>
<!-- tags:73-->						<li> - Buying new stocks</li>
<!-- tags:74-->						<li> - Launching marketing campaign</li>
<!-- tags:75-->						<p>The indicators take different forms:</p>
<!-- tags:76-->						<li> - optimal profitability point given the risk involved,</li>
<!-- tags:77-->						<li> - risk limits for extreme losses (tail risks),</li>
<!-- tags:78-->						<li> - statistics, which ascertain the suitability of the model or the need to update it.</li>
<!-- tags:79-->						<p>This stage is the most visible part of our project. The “users” will judge the solution’s qualities: suitability, adaptability, scalability and transparency.</p>
<!-- tags:80-->						<p>During this stage, questioning the model is critical. The analysis should not be considered an end point with the first success. It should be the stage where questions are posed.</p>
<!-- tags:81-->						<p>IT and mathematical skills and an accurate understanding of the business activity are essential. Moreover, effective communication during this stage is crucial. The “users” of the solutions should be convinced by the analysis.</p>
<!-- tags:82-->						<p>The division of the methodology into three steps is not as clear as it seems for two reasons:</p>
<!-- tags:83-->						<p>On one hand, the 3 stages are not totally independent from each other, even though they are conducted in chronological order. An undefined model cannot be simulated. An analysis cannot be performed without simulated data. The 3 stages are interconnected and validate each other. During the analysis, the missing parts and redundant elements must be corrected. Then, the analysis will be adjusted and the model simplified to make the simulation more efficient.</p>
<!-- tags:84-->						<p>On the other hand, the solution will be further developed due to the challenges of real application. Your project will be cadenced by milestones (prototype, first roll-out, correction … ). The risk analysis solution will change at the same pace. Any concrete difficulties may bring each of the 3 stages into question. The risk analysis solution is a scheme, not as restrictive as the real object. You should take advantage of this flexibility.</p>	
<!-- tags:85-->						<h2>4 Qualities</h2>
<!-- tags:86-->						<p>Initially, MSAskills defines four qualities as a prerequisite to the success of your risk analysis solution. Those four qualities will be used as guidelines to assess the completion of each step.</p>
<!-- tags:87-->						<p><strong>Suitabilty</strong></p>
<!-- tags:88-->						<p>The solution should take into account major risks within your business activity and present the most pertinent analysis. It focuses on your priorities.</p>
<!-- tags:89-->						<p><strong>Adaptability</strong></p>
<!-- tags:90-->						<p>Your risk analysis solution should be adapted to your business. Firstly, your risk analysis solution is not an end in itself; it should not slow down operational tasks. Secondly, your risk analysis solution should take advantage of your information system.</p>
<!-- tags:91-->						<p><strong>Scalability</strong>
<!-- tags:92-->						<p>Your risk analysis solution should be scalable. Today, it estimates the profitability of your future business activity to convince your investors. Tomorrow, thanks to your risk analysis solution, you can drive efficient and sustainable business growth.</p>
<!-- tags:93-->						<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
<!-- tags:94-->						<p>Above all, your risk analysis solution is a communication tool. The indicators, produced by your risk analysis solution, should be clear and intuitive for your collaborators, decision makers, and investors. Your solution is a service designed with your business in mind.</p>
